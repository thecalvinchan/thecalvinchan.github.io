I'm an avid snowboarder. Every winter season, I look forward to throwing myself off negatively steep slopes, for reasons unbeknownst to my parents (in fact, probably much to their dismay, as I'm sure having your only child strap himself onto a board and slide down a mountain is anything but reassuring). Now, by no means am I a great snowboarder. I've had my fair share of tumbles and falls that could have well earned me a spot on some Vine fail compilation. But that's not really what I want to talk about. No, I want to talk about the holy grail of runs that beginners and professionals alike can relate to. The double blacks.

If you've ever been snowboarding or skiing, I'm sure you can attest to the phenomenon that I'm about to describe. At the top of a double black run (or any run that's a bit too steep for your own comfort), you can see the whole world below you. Hell, you've probably even conjured up a visualization of the perfect run down the slope, hitting every corner and carving every turn. And if you're anything like me, before you're even able to taste your fears (let alone choke on them), you throw yourself down the slope, with ill regard of whether or not you can even make it to the bottom. And for those first few moments, you're invincible.

Guess what? You're not. Well, at least I'm not. After plunging down the slope, I run into all too many "oh shit I shouldn't have done that" moments. Maybe it's an icy patch that robs you of all control over your skiis, or maybe it's an inconspicious bump that launches you a foot or two up into the air. Regardless, at this moment, you're rapidly accelerating down a hill that perhaps (in that moment) you regret tackling in the first place. In that moment, you bail and your commitment falters. There's really only one thing that can happen next. You wipe out.

So what's the point of me describing all this. People get involved with things that are way over their heads, they get scared, and they fail. This isn't unique to snow sports. But what is unique about skiing or snowboarding is that even when you fall, there's really nowhere to go but forwards. Even when you wipe out on a steep run, your existing momentum will naturally carry you forwards and you will continue down the slope, whether you like it or not. If you're lucky, you'll make it to the bottom with all your limbs intact (lol). At the end of the run, **you'll still have made it from point A to point B and that's progress**, regardless of whether or not you wiped out somewhere between the two. But that's not even the most deterministic part. **What's really important is what happens after you wipe out and roll all the way to the bottom. Do you call it a day and head back to the lodge or do you hop on the lift to try it again?**

[When 2014 came around last year, I was in the fast lane doing things I never imagined myself doing](http://thecalvinchan.com/blog/2014/01/02/2013-a-year-in-review/). In a way, 2013 and 2014 were the two years that led me to the top of the double black. And man, when it came to it, I didn't think twice before hitting that run. It started off fast and before I knew it, I was in a different city almost every weekend pursuing opportunities that were unfathomable to me before. But believe me when I say that there were moments that really had me doubting myself – situations that were extremely scary and difficult to navigate through. And more than once, I found myself bailing on things I previously thought I was more than ready for. But at the same time, I still made progress. I grew more aware of my own capabilities and my self-awareness skyrocketted. I matured as a person, and met so many other "snowboarders and skiers" with whom I vibe with. And by the end of 2014, I made it to the bottom. Regardless of how many times I fell or bailed, I still made it from point A to point B; I made progress. At the end of the day, what more can you ask for?

I really love applying this snow sports metaphor to the way I live life because it has an unlimited number of interpretations. In a way, it's self contradictory. How can skiing down a slope (over and over again) be considered progress if all you're doing is just traveling between point A and point B. More so than anything else, I've learned that life is about more than just tangible returns. Sure, those are really important, but it's also important to zoom out and get a view of the bigger picture. When I snowboard, there's really no explicit goal I'm trying to achieve. I just want to have fun. Adrenaline pumps through my veins when I hit a jump or bomb a run, and it makes me feel alive. And sometimes, that's just what you need. Sometimes, you just need to live life ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

It's now five days into 2015 and, I don't know about you, but I'm already on that lift getting ready to do it all over again.
